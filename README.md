# Excel-Data-Analysis-Transfer-Project
Utilized Python to automate results transfer to excel.

The functionality of the program is to check if a workbook exists with a given name (under one's directory) if so then it writes under the first available row and if not then it creates a new workbook and worksheet, merges the first two rows and creates a specialized header and subheader in these rows with specific font types (sizes, names,boldness, centered) and then copies an array of data under the header and subheader automatically to the excel worksheet, and saves the file.

This is a quick and small project that was done as a base for a work project for a Simulations Company that wanted to automate the transfer of data to excel to avoid errors in manual copying and writing of data results (gotten from R&D measurement/testing instruments like force gauges).
